To create a Lifemap data visualization, you will have to follow these steps:

1. Import `Lifemap`
2. Prepare and load your data
3. If needed, aggregate you data with an [aggregation function](reference/index.html#aggregation-functions)
4. Initialize a [Lifemap](`~pylifemap.Lifemap`) object
5. Add visualization layers
6. [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) or [save()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.save`) the result


## Import Lifemap

To be able to use `pylifemap` in a script or notebook you have to import `Lifemap` from the package:

```{python}
from pylifemap import Lifemap
```



## Prepare your data

The data you want to visualize on the Lifemap tree of life must be in a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) or [polars](https://pola.rs) DataFrame. They must contain observations (species) as rows, and variables as columns, and one column must contain the NCBI taxonomy identifier of the species.

`pylifemap` includes an example dataset generated from [The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/19491596-35ae-4a91-9a98-85cf505f1bd3). It is a CSV file with the Red List category (in 2022) of more than 84000 species.

We can import it as a polars or pandas DataFrame with the following code:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Polars

```{python}
import polars as pl

iucn = pl.read_parquet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.parquet"
)
```

## Pandas

```{python}
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd

iucn = pd.read_parquet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.parquet"
)
```

:::

The resulting table only has two columns: `taxid`, which contains the species identifiers, and `status`, with the Red List category of each species.

```{python}
iucn
```


## Initialize a `Lifemap` object

The next step is to create a new [Lifemap](`~pylifemap.Lifemap`) object. To do this we have to pass it our DataFrame, as well as the name of the column with our taxonomy identifiers^[if your column is named "taxid" you can omit the `taxid_col` argument as it is its default value.]:

```{python}
#| eval: false
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid")
```

We could have passed other arguments such as the `width` and `height` of our visualization, either as a number of pixels or as a CSS unit.

For example, the following intiialization would make the visualization take the full available width, and an height of 800 pixels.

```{python}
#| eval: false
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid", width="100%", height=800)
```


## Add visualization layers

After initializing our `Lifemap` object, we must add visualization layers to create graphical representations.

Here are the available layers:

| Layer                                           | Description                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [layer_points](layers/layer_points.qmd)         | Displays each observation with a point. Radius and color can be dependent of an  attribute in the DataFrame. |
| [layer_lines](layers/layer_lines.qmd)           | Using aggregated data, highlights branches of the tree with lines of varying width and color.                |
| [layer_donuts](layers/layer_donuts.qmd)         | Displays aggregated categorical data as donut charts.                                                        |
| [layer_heatmap](layers/layer_heatmap.qmd)       | Displays a heatmap of the observations distribution in the tree.                                             |
| [layer_heatmap_deck](layers/layer_heatmap_deck.qmd)       | Displays a deck.gl heatmap of the observations distribution in the tree.                                             |
| [layer_screengrid](layers/layer_screengrid.qmd) | Displays the observations distribution with a colored grid with fixed-size cells..                           |

To add a layer, we call the corresponding `layer_` method of our `Lifemap` object. For example, to add a points layer:

```{python}
#| eval: false
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid").layer_points()
```

We can add several layers by calling several methods. For example we could display a heatmap layer, and a points layer above it:

```{python}
#| eval: false
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid").layer_heatmap().layer_points()
```

## Show or save the visualization

Just adding layers is not sufficient to see our visualization. For it to appear, we have to call the [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) method:

```{python}
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid").layer_points().show()
```

::: {.callout-note}
When in a notebook environment, calling [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) will display the visualisation as a widget. When called from a Python script or a Python REPL, the visualization will be saved to a temporary file and, if possible, displayed in the user's browser. When called from a Python script running inside our Docker container, it will be saved to a file in the working directory.
:::

We can also save it to an HTML file which can be opened later in a browser by using the [save()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.save`) method:

```{python}
#| eval: false
Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid").layer_points().save("lifemap.html")
```


## Customize the layers

Each layer accepts a certain number of arguments to customize its appearance. For example we can change the radius, color and opacity of our points:


```{python}
(
    Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid")
    .layer_points(fill="#EFB118", radius=5, opacity=0.5)
    .show()
)
```

Instead of providing fixed values to `fill` or `radius`, we can also pass data column names to make size or color depending on the column values. For example, we can make the color of the points depending on their `status`:

```{python}
(
    Lifemap(iucn, taxid_col="taxid")
    .layer_points(fill="status", radius=4, opacity=0.9)
    .show()
)
```



## Aggregate data

`pylifemap` provides several functions that allow to aggregate data along the branches of the tree:



| Function                                                     | Description                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [aggregate_count](`~pylifemap.aggregations.aggregate_count`) | Aggregates the number of children of each tree node.                                                |
| [aggregate_num](`~pylifemap.aggregations.aggregate_num`)     | Aggregates a numerical variable along the tree branches with a given function (sum , mean, max...). |
| [aggregate_freq](`~pylifemap.aggregations.aggregate_freq`)   | Aggregates the frequencies of the levels of a categorical variable.                                 |



For example, we could filter our dataset to only keep the species with an "extinct" status:


::: {.panel-tabset}

## Polars

```{python}
iucn_extinct = iucn.filter(pl.col("status") == "Extinct")
```

## Pandas

```{python}
#| eval: false
iucn_extinct = iucn[iucn["status"] == "Extinct"]
```

:::


We can then aggregate their count along the branches with [aggregate_count](`~pylifemap.aggregations.aggregate_count`):

```{python}
from pylifemap import aggregate_count
iucn_extinct_agg = aggregate_count(iucn_extinct)
iucn_extinct_agg
```

Finally, we can represent this new dataset with a lines layer, making the lines width and color depending on the aggregated count values.

```{python}
(
    Lifemap(iucn_extinct_agg)
    .layer_lines(color="n", width="n", label="Extinct species")
    .show()
)
```
