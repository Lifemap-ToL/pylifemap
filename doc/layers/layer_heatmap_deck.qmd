title: Deck.gl heatmap layer
---

The heatmap layer displays observations distribution as a heatmap overlay provided by [deck.gl](https://deck.gl).

The `radius`, `intensity`, `threshold` and `opacity` arguments can be used to customize the heatmap appearance.

```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_parquet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.parquet"
)

(
    Lifemap(iucn)
    .layer_heatmap_deck(opacity=0.5)
    .show()
)
```

For a detailed list of `layer_heatmap_deck` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_heatmap_deck`).

For an alternative heatmap visualization, see [layer_heatmap](layer_heatmap.qmd).
