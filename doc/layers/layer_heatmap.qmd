title: Heatmap layer
---

The heatmap layer displays observations distribution as a heatmap overlay. 


```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juba/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

(
    Lifemap(iucn)
    .layer_heatmap(opacity=0.5)
    .show()
)
```

For a detailed list of `layer_heatmap` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_heatmap`).
