title: Lines layer
---

The lines layer displays aggregated observations (count or numerical variable) by highlighting branches of the tree.

The `color` and `width` arguments allow to modify the size and color of the lines. They can either be fixed values (numerical for `width`, an hexadecimal color code for `color`) or data column names. In this case, width or color will depend on the column values.


```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap, aggregate_count

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

# Aggregate observations count along branches
iucn_agg = aggregate_count(iucn)

(
    Lifemap(iucn_agg)
    .layer_lines(color="n", width="n", opacity=0.6)
    .show()
)
```

For a detailed list of `layer_lines` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_lines`).
