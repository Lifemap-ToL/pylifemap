title: Lines layer
---

The lines layer displays aggregated observations (count or numerical variable) by highlighting branches of the tree. 

It is possible to make the color and the width of the lines depending on a data variable.

```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap, aggregate_count

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juba/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

# Aggregate observations count along branches
iucn_agg = aggregate_count(iucn)

(
    Lifemap(iucn_agg)
    .layer_lines(color_col="n", width_col="n", opacity=0.6)
    .show()
)
```

For a detailed list of `layer_lines` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_lines`).
