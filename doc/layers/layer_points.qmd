title: Points layer
---

The points layer displays observations as points on the lifemap tree. 

It is possible to make the fill color and the radius of the points depending on a data variable.

```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap, aggregate_count

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juba/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

# Aggregate observations count along branches
iucn_agg = aggregate_count(iucn)

(
    Lifemap(iucn_agg)
    .layer_points(fill_col="n", radius_col="n", opacity=0.7, popup=True)
    .show()
)
```

For a detailed list of `layer_points` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_points`).
