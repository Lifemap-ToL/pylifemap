title: Screengrid layer
---

The screengrid layer displays observations distribution as a colored grid with fixed-size cells. 


::: {.callout-note}
This visualization is highly sensitive to the current zoom level and extent. Small modifications of the view can lead to very different visual representations.
:::

```{python}
import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

(
    Lifemap(iucn)
    .layer_screengrid(opacity=0.5)
    .show()
)
```


For a detailed list of `layer_screengrid` arguments you can take a look at its [documentation](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.layer_screengrid`).
