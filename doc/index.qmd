## Overview

`pylifemap` is a jupyter widget allowing to visualize taxonomy data on [Lifemap](https://lifemap-ncbi.univ-lyon1.fr). It provides several visualisation layers, as well as aggregation functions allowing to aggregate data along the tree branches.

Here is a simple example:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from pylifemap import Lifemap

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juba/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.csv"
)

Lifemap(iucn).layer_points(radius=5, opacity=0.1).show()
```

## Installation and usage

For the moment the package can only be installed from Github:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/juba/pylifemap.git
```

- [Getting started](getting_started.qmd) gives general usage instructions.
- The *Layers* section shows visual interactive examples of the different available layers.
- [Reference](reference/index.qmd) provides detailed documentation of the different methods and functions.


## Credits

- The `iucn` data files in the `data/` directory have been generated from [The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/19491596-35ae-4a91-9a98-85cf505f1bd3) dataset (DOI [10.15468/0qnb58](https://doi.org/10.15468/0qnb58)).
- Visualizations are powered by [Open Layers](https://openlayers.org) and [deck.gl](https://deck.gl).
- The widget is developed thanks to the [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev) framework.
