## Overview

`pylifemap` is a jupyter widget allowing to visualize taxonomy data on [Lifemap](https://lifemap.cnrs.fr). It provides several visualisation layers, as well as aggregation functions allowing to aggregate data along the tree branches.

Here is a simple example:

```{python}
#| warning: false

import polars as pl
from pylifemap import Lifemap

# Load iucn dataset
iucn = pl.read_parquet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/main/data/iucn.parquet"
)

Lifemap(iucn).layer_points(radius=5, opacity=0.8).show()

```
