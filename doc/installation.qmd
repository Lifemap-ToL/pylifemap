## Notebook run / script run

As it provides a Jupyter widget, `pylifemap` is primarily designed to be used in a notebook environment such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) or [Marimo](https://marimo.io).

It can also be used in a Python script or in the Python REPL. In this case you can use the [save()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.save`) method to export the widget to an HTML file that can be opened later. You can also use the [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) method, in this case the widget is exported to a temporary file and opened in the user's browser.

`pylifemap` visualizations can also be embedded in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents in HTML format.

## Install locally

For the moment only the development version can be installed from Github.

You can add the package to a script or project with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv add git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git
```

You can also install it (preferably in a virtual environment) with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git
```

## Run directly with `uv`

You can run `pylifemap` directly with `uv run` using a `--with` argument:

```sh
# Run a Jupyter session
uv run --with git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git jupyter-lab

# Run a marimo session
uv run --with git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git marimo edit

# Run a custom script
uv run --with git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git my_script.py
```



## Run in Google Colab

You can try the package (without installing anything) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The easiest way is by using our [introduction notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/blob/master/notebooks/introduction.ipynb) directly in Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/blob/master/notebooks/introduction.ipynb).

## Run with `juv`

[juv](https://github.com/manzt/juv) is a toolkit for reproducible Jupyter notebooks, powered by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

You can easily create and run a notebook with `pylifemap` with:

```sh
juv init notebook.ipynb
juv add notebook.ipynb git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git
juv run notebook.ipynb
```


## Run with Docker

Another way to use the package without having to install it is to use our [Docker image](https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/pkgs/container/pylifemap).

### Run in Jupyter

To use `pylifemap` in a Jupyter environment, open a terminal in the directory containing your data and notebook files, and run:

```sh
docker run -it -p 8899:8899 -v $PWD:/local/ ghcr.io/lifemap-tol/pylifemap:latest
```

Open the following URL in your browser: <http://127.0.0.1:8899/lab>, and you will have access to a Jupyter notebook environment with `pylifemap` and its dependencies preinstalled.



### Run a script

If you just want to run a Python script generating a pylifemap visualization, you can open a terminal in the script directory and run the following command:

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/local/ ghcr.io/lifemap-tol/pylifemap:latest myscript.py
```

In this case, if you use [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) in your script the result will not be opened in your browser but will instead be saved in a `lifemap.html` file in your working directory.
