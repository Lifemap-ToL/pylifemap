## Notebook run / script run

As it provides a Jupyter widget, `pylifemap` is primarily designed to be used in a notebook environment such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). 

But it is also possible to use it in a Python script or in the Python REPL. In this case you can use the [save()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.save`) method to export the widget to an HTML file that can be opened later. You can also use the [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) method, ins this case the widget is exported to a temporary file and opened in the user's browser.

`pylifemap` visualizations can also be embedded in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents in HTML format.

## Install locally

You can install the package locally (preferably in a virtual environment) with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

For the moment only the development version can be installed from Github with the following command:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap.git
```

## Run in Google Colab

You can try the package (without installing anything) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The easiest way is by using our [introduction notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/blob/master/notebooks/introduction.ipynb) directly in Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/blob/master/notebooks/introduction.ipynb).


## Run with Docker

### Run in Jupyter

Another way to use the package without having to install it is to use our [Docker image](https://github.com/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap/pkgs/container/pylifemap).

To use `pylifemap` in a Jupyter environment, you have to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), open a terminal in the directory containing your data and notebook files, and run:

```sh
docker run -it -p 8899:8899 -v $PWD:/local/ ghcr.io/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap:latest
```

Open the following URL in your browser: <http://127.0.0.1:8899/lab>, and you will have access to a Jupyter notebook environment with `pylifemap` and its dependencies preinstalled.

### Run a script

If you just want to run a Python script generating a pylifemap visualization, you can open a terminal in the script directory and run the following command:

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/local/ ghcr.io/Lifemap-ToL/pylifemap:latest myscript.py
```

In this case, if you use [show()](`~pylifemap.Lifemap.show`) in your script the result will not be opened in your browser but will instead be saved in a `lifemap.html` file in your working directory.
