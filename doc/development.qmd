## Install from git

To install `pylifemap` from git:

```sh 
pip install git+https://github.com/juba/pylifemap.git
```

## Install fom source

If you want to build `pylifemap` from source, you'll have to follow these steps:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) dependency management system
- Clone the [pylifemap](https://github.com/juba/pylifemap) repository
- Install Python dependencies with : `hatch shell`
- Install JavaScript dependencies with : `npm install --workspaces --include-root-workspace`


## Widget JavaScript modification and bundling

Each time the widget JavaScript or CSS code is modified in the `src/js/` or `packages/lifemapjs` directories, it must be bundled with one of the following commands in `pylifemap`:

```sh
# Bundle only once
npm run bundle
# Or, to bundle and watch for code change
npm run dev
```

The result is put into `src/pylifemap/static`.
